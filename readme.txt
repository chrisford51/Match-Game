This game was created to complete the following tasks: 
  - Store objects, such as icons, in a List<T> object 
  - Use a foreach loop in C# to iterate through items in a list 
  - Keep track of a form's state by using reference variables 
  - Build an event handler to respond to events that you can use with multiple objects 
  - Make a timer that counts down and then fires an event exactly once after being started
